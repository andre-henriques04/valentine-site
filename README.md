# Valentine Site 💌

A small, intentional Valentine’s Day website for my girlfriend. Created as part of a handwritten card + QR code experience. 

This project is designed to be **mobile-first**, **static**, and **personal**. The physical card carries the letter; the website carries the moment.

## 🌹 Project Idea

The flow of the experience is simple and deliberate:

1. A handwritten card is given and read.
2. The card asks: *“Will you scan my QR code?”*
3. The QR code opens this website.
4. The site unfolds as a short, scroll-based story.
5. At the end, it asks the Valentine’s question.
