                I didn't know what love felt like until I met you. Four months ago we were strangers on an app,
                and now you're the person I want to tell everything to—the person I feel most like myself with.
                Being with you feels like coming home.

                    <p>
                        I was nervous before our first date. Like, actually nervous. But the moment I saw you,
                        everything felt right. Like maybe you were always meant to be mine. That night at the
                        Stars & Stripes drive-in was just the beginning.

                        Date four. A Chick-fil-A parking lot. "You should put some chapstick on," I said.
                        Then: "Actually, I should take it off." Our first kiss. Still think about that moment
                        all the time.

                        I had flowers hidden in my closet—badly. You saw them when I opened the door to grab
                        something, and I saw you notice. We both pretended nothing happened. Later that day I
                        asked you to be my girlfriend. You said yes. Best decision I ever made.

                        Late-night talks where we say things we've never told anyone. Trolling each other like idiots.
                        Chipotle runs (obviously). The way our intimacy feels like home—the way you fall asleep on me
                        and I never want to move. You're my first love, and honestly? I can't imagine it any other way.
