            <p>I didn't know what love felt like until I met you.</p>
            <p>Four months ago we were strangers on an app, and now you're the person I want to tell everything to—the person I feel most like myself with.</p>

        <!-- First Photo - Football -->

            <h2>The Drive-In</h2>
            <p>I was nervous before our first date. Like, actually nervous. But the moment I saw you, everything felt right. Like maybe you were always meant to be mine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>That night at the Stars & Stripes drive-in was just the beginning.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>The Chick-fil-A Kiss</h2>
            <p>Date four. A Chick-fil-A parking lot.</p>
            <p>"You should put some chapstick on," I said.</p>
            <p>Then: "Actually, I should take it off."</p>
            <p>Our first kiss. Still think about that moment all the time.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>October 1st</h2>
            <p>I had flowers hidden in my closet—badly. You saw them when I opened the door to grab something, and I saw you notice. We both pretended nothing happened.</p>
            <p>Later that day I asked you to be my girlfriend. You said yes. Best decision I ever made.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Everything We Are</h2>
            <p>Late-night talks where we say things we've never told anyone. Trolling each other like idiots. Chipotle runs (obviously).</p>
            <p>The way our intimacy feels like home—the way you fall asleep on me and I never want to move.</p>
            <p>You're my first love, and honestly? I can't imagine it any other way.</p>
